        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>Labeling myself is a difficult task because I tend to become a mini-expert in everything I do. I dabble in a lot of different things, but what I enjoy most is&nbsp;being&nbsp;creative.</p>
        <p>At Longwood University, I studied animation and graphic design. Though I enjoyed both, I started to favor the technical side and dove straight into coding. For my senior project, I made a game in Unity which I coded in C#. This was my introduction to coding and gave me confidence to continue&nbsp;my&nbsp;studies.</p>
        <p>The University of Richmond presented me with an opportunity to expand my coding skillset. I attended and later graduated with a vast knowledge of full-stack development. This 6-month course not only proved my ability to learn, but also the speed at which I could learn&nbsp;new&nbsp;concepts.</p>
        <br />
        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <p>As a necessity for understanding how games work, I enjoy playing and modding games. Getting a peek behind the scenes of my favorite games has driven my passion of becoming a&nbsp;game&nbsp;developer.</p>
        <p>On the side, I enjoy creating and playing music. Whether I'm jamming out on the guitar, or calming down on the piano, music is my relaxation. I also bang on the drums from time to time when I'm feeling&nbsp;not-so-calm.</p>
        <br />
        <h1>Principles</h1>
        <p>The technical and formulaic aspects of coding are what I most enjoy. In my future, I'm going to strive to make something no one has ever seen before. I understand that pouring your heart and soul into your work can be stressful, but undoubtably gives you the best result. This is what I live by. I believe that no matter what you are doing, you should always give&nbsp;it&nbsp;your&nbsp;all.</p>
        <p>As a game developer, I understand how mechanics can make or break the gameplay experience. As a designer and web developer, I know what a clean, responsive interface can do for a business. I enjoy technical aspects of design & development and polishing critical details that others may overlook. I am fully confident in proving what I say I can do. Contact me and let's&nbsp;work&nbsp;together.</p>
