    <h2 id="headBody">About Me</h2>
    <p>I like to think of myself as a designer, developer & technical artist. I dabble in a lot of different things, but what enjoy most is being creative. I've always been creative as a kid, which is where my dream of becoming a game developer started.</p>
    <br>
    <p>At Longwood University, I studied animation and graphic design. though I enjoyed both, I started to become more of a technical person and dove straight into coding. For my senior project, I made a game in the Unity Engine which I coded in C#. This was my introduction to coding and it gave me the hope that my dream could become real.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The technical and formulaic aspects of coding are what I most enjoy. In my future, I'm going to strive to make something no one has ever seen before. I understand that pouring your heart and soul into your work can be stressful, but undoubtably gives you the best result. This is what I live by. I believe that no matter what you are doing, you should always give it your all.</p>
