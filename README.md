### RESUME:

OBJECTIVE STATEMENT

As a game developer, I understand how mechanics can make or break the gameplay experience.
As a designer and web developer, I know what a clean, responsive interface can do for your business.
I enjoy technical aspects of design & development and polishing critical details that others may overlook.
I am fully confident in proving what I say I can do. (I am searching for the opportunity to prove what I can accomplish.)
Contact me and let's work together.
