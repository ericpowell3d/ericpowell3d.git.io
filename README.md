OBJECTIVE STATEMENT

As a designer and web developer, I know what a clean, responsive interface can do for your business.
As a game developer, I understand how mechanics can make or break the gameplay experience.
I enjoy technical aspects of design & development and obsessing over details that others may overlook.
I find problems and I solve them.
I am searching for experience to prove what I can accomplish.
